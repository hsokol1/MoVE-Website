                    and co-director of the Inequality and Policy Research Center. She earned her Ph.D. and M.A. in political science from the University 
                    of California, San Diego and her B.A. from Brown University. Her research spans comparative politics, political economy, political geography,

                <p class="personpr">
                    Dr. Rogers studies the political economy of inequality, particularly the territorial distribution of resources and its effects on policymaking, 
                    state-building, and fiscal development. Much of her recent work examines inequalities in voting access for Native Americans and the institutional 
                    roots of spatial inequality. She is the author of <i>Geography, Capacity, and Inequality I: Spatial Inequality (2022)</i> and has a forthcoming 
                    companion volume on redistribution, in addition to a developing manuscript on the political economy of Native American voting rights. Her scholarship

                    and includes extensive collaborative research on voter equity, decentralization, and geographic measurement in political science.

                    Dr. Tessa Provins is an Assistant Professor in the School 
                    of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona. 
                    Prior to joining Arizona, she served as an Assistant Professor in the Political Science 
                    Department at the University of Pittsburgh from 2018 to 2024. She earned her M.A. (2016) and Ph.D. (2018) in 
                    Political Science from the University of California, Merced and received her B.A. in Economics from Stanford University in 2013.
                </p>
                <p class="personpr">
                    Dr. Provins's research focuses on American legislative institutions and Indigenous institutions and policy. In her work on American 
                    institutions, she examines how the design of legislative bodies shapes outcomes for groups divided by race, gender, and party affiliation. 
                    Her research on Indigenous institutions analyzes the structure of Native American tribal governments and their effects on intra-tribal, 
                    inter-tribal, and government relationships, as well as policy outcomes. While she conducts tribal case studies, much of her work on Indigenous 
                    politics takes a pan-tribal approach. Her scholarship has been published in leading journals such as the <i>Journal of Public Policy, 
                    Political Research Quarterly, and Legislative Studies Quarterly</i>.
